# Trustless

The password manager for trustless people (like me).

## Why should trust trustless

Actually, you should not. Instead you are invited to do a thorough code-review
yourself. Trustless is entirely open-source and can be easily compiled by
yourself - with some very basic programming skills that is.

Eventually there will be some installation packages, but the main idea behind
this project is to give full insight what happens to the information you store
and how it is protected.
